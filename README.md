# Spotify Recommender!
The Spotify Recommender is a web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Spotify API.
It asks the user a variety of questions in the form of a quiz and recommends the user a song on
Spotify based on their quiz results.
I became inspired to create a web quiz after a couple of friends showed me [this cute fruit quiz](https://github.com/Gudetea/FruitCard-Odyssey) that they found online! Thanks for the inspiration [Gudetea](https://github.com/Gudetea)!
