## üß† Be Moar Smart

- [ ] Review function/variable names and make sure they make sense

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring
- [ ] Create fewer elements with JS
- [x] Simplify scoring (we don't need to list genres we aren't adding scores to) - maybe we can condense choiceweights and choices together
- [ ] Think about simpler ways to find the highest scoring genre
- [x] Convert genres to an array/object

## üßòüèª Stretch Goals
- [x] Add to portfolio
- [ ] Design Logo
- [ ] Add additional types of recommendations (playlists, albums, whatever)
- [ ] Add another API to output data along with the Spotify API
- [x] Allow user to save recommendations
