# To Do
Let's see if we can't set up a plan for making this thing truly epic.

## üß† Be Moar Smart
- [x] Make sure you know what your code is doing
- [x] Metadata
- [x] Style the app

## üèÖ Best Practices
- [x] Pull requests
- [x] Get branching setup in repo
- [x] Pull Spotify code out into its own file
- [ ] ~~Move secret keys to Actions variable~~ New Authorization method makes it so secret keys are not needed in the code
- [x] Convert JS styling changes to CSS

## üßπ Clean UP
- [x] Clean up clutter
- [x] Remove extra comments
- [x] Get rid of extra token requests
- [x] Get rid of unused variables
- [x] Review function/variable names and make sure they make sense

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring
- [x] Create fewer elements with JS
- [x] Simplify scoring (we don't need to list genres we aren't adding scores to) - maybe we can condense choiceweights and choices together
- [x] Think about simpler ways to find the highest scoring genre
- [x] Convert genres to an array/object

## üßòüèª Stretch Goals
- [x] Add to portfolio
- [x] Design Logo
- [ ] ~~Add additional types of recommendations (playlists, albums, whatever)~~ Decided to stick with just a single song recommendation for now
- [x] Add another API to output data along with the Spotify API
- [x] Allow user to save recommendations
